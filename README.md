# Automate Python 

This project is to learn the book _Automate the boring stuff with Python: practical programming for total beginners_

We will write python code in this directory, including transcribed code from the book and original code from transcribed code written by ourselves. 

The name of transcribed files is same with the file in the book, and we add comments for almost every python code line that we don't completely know before. If you don't understand the comment about a code chunk in the book, you can check it out from my source code in py directory or project directory. 

## Project directory

The project directory include source code and its related files (include files created by source code, files needed from source code)
